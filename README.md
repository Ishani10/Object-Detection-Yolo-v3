Real time Object Detection and Recognition using YOLO-v3 

Detection and recognition of objects have been termed as a technology to detect the connotated objects of a defined class in digital images or images. This has been the foundation of real time applications such as face detection applications, self-driving cars, pedestrian detection etc. It also is utilized in various fields of computer vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance.

 

Accuracy in detecting a moving object is critical for application in the real world. By including the object classification from multiple sensor detections, the model of the object or environment can be identified more accurately. The critical parameters involved in improving the accuracy are the size and the speed of the moving object. All sensor data are to be used in defining a composite object representation so that it could be used for the class information in the core object’s description. This composite data can then be used by a deep learning network for complete perception fusion in order to solve the detection and tracking of moving objects problem. Camera image data from subsequent frames along the time axis in conjunction with the speed and size of the object will further contribute in developing better recognition algorithms.

 

Special purpose object detection systems need to be fast, accurate and dedicated to classifying a handful but relevant number of objects. Our aim was to integrate a system which utilizes the Inception’s vast heuristically mapped image pre-diction tree along-with a real time system accurate and robust enough to work at various processing powers and give the user enough confidence of identifying and detecting object with a single frame. As this property can be utilized at huge number of places relying on real time detection, it might not be limited to only driving assistance or autonomous driving systems, but are beyond the scope of this project.
